#Vector Databases and Generative AI: The Next Step for Data Engineers#
As the landscape of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, Generative AI is at the forefront, pushing the boundaries of what machines can create and comprehend. However, to power these sophisticated models, it's not enough to have traditional structured or unstructured data. Generative AI models rely on vectorized representations of data, requiring a new type of database optimized for this: Vector Databases.

In this blog, we'll explore how vector databases work in the context of Generative AI, specifically focusing on Amazon OpenSearch Service, and why data engineers need to upskill in building pipelines for such databases.
